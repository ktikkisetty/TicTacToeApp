#My Project: Tic-Tac-Toe
###By Krishnaja Tikkisetty

I will be creating an application that allows two users to play Tic-Tac-Toe. The application will do the following:

- Keep a list of what spaces are occupied and which ones are empty, as well as which symbol is occupying
  them

- Keep track of whose turn it is

- Place correct symbol on the square that was clicked

- Recognize who won, who lost, or if the game was a stalemate.

- Ends game when someone wins or the board is full

- In console only stage, will display the list of spaces when requested.
